          tbh i've been struggling with making music for a while now. <br />
          overthinking, trying to meet unrealistic excpetations, <br />
          constantly comparing myself and even avoiding making songs.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don't think that i've found a solution but I know I have to start
          over,<br />
          care less and create like I was a kid again.
